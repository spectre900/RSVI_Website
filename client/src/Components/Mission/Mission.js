                        The mission of RSVI is, undoubtedly, to empower the blind in such a manner that after becoming educationally, socially, economically and psychologically rehabilitated, he/she should be capable enough to extend helping hands to even the non-disabled persons, RSVI aims at putting an end to the problem of availability of reading material in accesible format with quality and perfection.

                        Becoming independent is not what RSVI strives for, its ultimate goal is to empower the vusually challanged in such a manne that after becoming independent he/she embarks upon a tedious journey of making others.
